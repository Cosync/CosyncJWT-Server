# CosyncJWT Server
## CosyncJWT Authentication Server for MongoDB Atlas App Services
CosyncJWT is a self hosted server with an [administrative portal](https://portal.cosync.net).

For the best possible experience, MongoDB Atlas App Services suggests using a JWT authentication provider based on JSON Web Tokens. CosyncJWT allows you to quickly implement JWT authentication with user metadata, two factor authentication (2FA) with Twilio/Google Authenticator, gated entry, strong password filtering, and SendGrid email integration for password reset and signup emails from your domain.
